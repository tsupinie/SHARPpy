Installation Guide
==================

SHARPpy code can be installed on *Windows, macOS, and Linux*, as all these platforms can run Python programs.  SHARPpy may run on other operating systems, but this has not been tested by the developers.  Chances are if it can run Python, it can run SHARPpy.  

SHARPpy can be installed from one of these three places: 

* a pre-compiled binary executable
* a Python package manager (:command:`pip` and :command:`conda`)
* from source (downloaded from Github).  

Binary executables are available for Windows (64 bit) and macOS 10.6+ (Snow Leopard and later; 64 bit only).

Installing a pre-compiled binary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You probably would like to go this route if you are not familiar with command line interfaces such as those on Linux or macOS. 
Pre-compiled binaries are available on the Github Releases page.  These are regenerated by Continuous 
Integration software with each update we make to the primary code base:

https://github.com/sharppy/SHARPpy/releases/

Installing a pre-compiled binary *should* be as simple as downloading the .zip file and extracting it to the location of your choice.  The zip files are named for the operating system and number of bits.  Most recently-built computers (probably post-2010 or so) should have 64-bit operating systems installed.  If your computer is older and you're unsure whether it has a 32- or 64-bit operating system, you can check on Windows 7 by clicking Start, right-clicking on Computer, and selecting Properties.  All recent versions of OS X (10.6 and newer) should be 64-bit.

Installing using package managers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SHARPpy is also available for download through the :command:`conda` and :command:`pip` package managers.  Both package managers will also take care of downloading the correct dependencies SHARPpy needs to run.  These package managers may be accessible through the command line interface of your operating system.  You may be interested in this route should you want to do scripting with the SHARPpy package and also work with the GUI.

From conda
----------

The Anaconda Python Distribution can be downloaded here: https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/
We recommend you download the *Python 3.6* version of the Anaconda Python distribution.  SHARPpy is
primarily tested using this distribution.

.. prompt:: bash

    conda install -c sharppy sharppy

From pip
--------

If you hate snakes, you may want to use :command:`pip` instead: 

.. prompt:: bash

    pip install sharppy

Installing the code from source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may wish to go this route if you are interested in contributing to the SHARPpy project.  You should become familiar with the :command:`git` program.
:command:`git` is a version control manager that tracks changes made to the code base.  If you would like to go this route, you will need to 
install the required packages manually.  These instructions assume that you have the Anaconda Python distribution. 

*Required Python Packages/Libraries:*

* NumPy
* PySide
* requests
* python-dateutil

Since SHARPpy requires these packages, you will need to install them.  If you choose to use the Anaconda distribution, Numpy comes installed by default.  PySide, requests, and python-dateutil can be installed through the Anaconda package manager that comes with the Anaconda distribution by opening up your command line program (Terminal in macOS/Linux and Command Prompt in Windows) and typing:

.. prompt:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge pyside=1.2.4 requests python-dateutil

After installing all the required Python packages for SHARPpy, you now can install the SHARPpy package to your computer.  You'll need to download it to your computer first and open up a command line prompt.  You can download it as a ZIP file (link on the right) or clone the Git respository (you will need the git program) into a directory on your computer by typing this into your command line:

.. prompt:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/sharppy/SHARPpy.git

If you decide you wish to contribute to the code, you will want to make a fork of the SHARPpy project on Github.
This will create a copy of the repository that you can work with.  After you have have made changes to your for, you can submit a "pull request"
that allows the managers of the SHARPpy project to "pull" your contributions into the main repository.

If you follow the route of cloning SHARPpy, you can update to the most recent SHARPpy package by typing the following within the folder you downloaded SHARPpy to:

.. prompt:: bash

    git pull origin master

Once the package has been downloaded to your computer, use your command line to navigate into the SHARPpy directory and type this command in to install SHARPpy:

.. prompt:: bash

    python setup.py install

After installing the package, you can run the SHARPpy GUI and interact with the SHARPpy libraries through Python scripts.
The GUI can be launched similar to the method described above in the "Installing from conda or pip" section.
